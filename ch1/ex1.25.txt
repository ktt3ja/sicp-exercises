Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of
extra work in writing expmod. After all, she says, since we already
know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply written

(define (expmod base exp m)
(remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))

Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime
tester? Explain.


Answer: If we assume unlimited memory size, her code should give the same
answer as the original expmod procedure. However, it is not efficient
because the original expmod ensures that intermediate values of the
recursion do not exceed a certain amount (maybe max{m^2, b^2}).
