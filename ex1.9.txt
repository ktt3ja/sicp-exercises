This procedure defines a recursive process because it builds up a chain
of deferred operation--that is, it keeps expanding and expanding until
it reaches a base case--and then eventually contracts when it can start
evaluating the argument.

This procedure defines an iterative process because a fixed number of
variables is used to keep track throughout. In particular, the process
doesn't expand and then contract; instead, it remains at fixed size.
